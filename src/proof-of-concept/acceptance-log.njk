  <h2>Latest Validation: Schema & AI Recognition</h2>
  <p>
    As of <time datetime="2025-11-02">2 November 2025</time>, the 
    <strong>Schema.org Structured Data Validator</strong> accepts 
    <code>itemtype="https://valiterm.org/Product"</code> and related Valiterm types 
    without errors or warnings, confirming full syntactic compatibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google’s new <strong>Search AI (Gemini-based)</strong> also reads and interprets 
    Valiterm markup correctly — including the <code>data-becon</code> microformat 
    and attributes such as <code>appliesTo="allOffers"</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, legacy validation systems such as the 
    <strong>Rich Results Test</strong> and <strong>Merchant Center</strong> 
    report “no structured data detected”, confirming that Valiterm markup does not 
    interfere with advertising eligibility or schema conflicts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on consistent interpretation in Search AI, it is <em>assumed</em> that 
    Google Ads AI also parses Valiterm semantics.  
    This assumption is currently being tested — the hypothesis is not yet verified.

<h2>Legend</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Level 1 – Not ignored:</strong> Crawlers follow links and index pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 2 – Context usage:</strong> Definitions are used for interpretation in AI/snippets.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 3 – Authoritative source:</strong> Valiterm appears as a cited source in AI answers.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Validation Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Valiterm has been tested against multiple AI systems (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT). All point in the same direction:
    structured, well-labeled metadata leads to more accurate interpretation of technical tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Differences between systems are mostly about <strong>timing</strong>, not <strong>direction</strong>.
    In short, <em>time is the variable</em>.

    <ul>
      <li>Parsing of tables with proper <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>Use of defined terms (Valiterm + Schema.org) and cross-page linking for context.</li>
